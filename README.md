# RESHATOR

### What is it?
Reshator is a program that solves simple school physics tasks using templates. This project was created back in 2019 to get a yearly grade A (which I actually got by the way). I considered this project lost until I started looking through my old flash drives. I think it's my worst project out of all, but despite that, itâ€™s exactly this project that taught me how to make GUI in Python using the PyGame library. This skill later came in handy for creating the Mondealy Mod Installer and GUI Shell Emulator.
